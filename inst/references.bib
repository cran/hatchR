	abstract = {To determine whether the embryonic period of channel catfish lctalurus punctatus could be extended at low temperatures, fertilized channel catfish eggs were incubated at five constant water temperatures: 4, 11. 16. 21, and 26 C. Low-temperature incubation of catfish eggs extended the embryonic period at 16 (244\%) and 21 C (56\%) when compared to the control hatchery incubation temperature of 26 C. All eggs incubated at 4 and 11 C died within 24–48 h. Developmental stage had a significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05) effect on percent hatch at 16, 21, and 26 C. Eggs held at 16 C prior to embryonic axis formation died within 48 h. Larvae from eggs hatched at 16 C were incompletely developed and died upon acclimation to 26 C for growth tests. Growth of fry reared at 26 C, following egg incubation at 21 C. paralleled that of fry from eggs incubated at 26 C. The underdevelopment of fry at 16 C combined with the significant effect of egg stage on survival at this temperature suggests that 16 C is below the lower thermal tolerance limit for normal development in this species. The period prior to the formation of the embryonic axis may be considered a vulnerable stage in channel catfish development. Increasing the embryonic period through low temperature incubation would increase the duration of juvenile availability for researchers and commercial operations.},

	abstract = {Lake sturgeon larval drift is not uniform in time or space and subsequent efforts to determine the relative abundance have suffered because of the lack of information during this early life history period. The purpose of this study was to obtain information about the early life history of lake sturgeon, determine the extent and duration of lake sturgeon larval drift, and examine this relationship to water flow and temperature in the Upper Black River, Michigan. This study also compares the results of other studies to further evaluate the dispersion of larvae. Larval production was quantified using drift nets anchored to the stream bottom from May to June in 2000–2002. Larval drift nets captured 780 larvae in 2000; 2975 larvae in 2001; and 2041 larvae in 2002. For the 2000, 2001, and 2002 spawning season, we estimated that 7107 (95\% CL: ± 1470), 17 409 (95\% CL: ± 5163), and 15 820 (95\% CL: ± 3168) larval lake sturgeon were produced in the Upper Black River (UBR), respectively. Catch per unit effort values of drifting larvae were greatest after peak water flows, with most larvae captured in the middle of the river channel. A mean daily water temperature above 16°C was an important environmental stimulus that influenced peak larval dispersion away from spawning sites. The results of this study suggested that natural reproduction was still occurring in the Black Lake system.},

	abstract = {Field observations indicated considerable loss of eggs of smallmouth bass and a high incidence of fungus infection in the nests in Cayuga Lake, New York, and tributaries. To investigate the possible effect of temperature changes on embryo survival, several tests were run using constant-temperature facilities at the Cornell University Insectary. In 1945, two trials were run raising the temperature of developing ova from 53° to 77° F., and no eggs were killed. During 1946, eggs developing at 65° F. were transferred at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 days following fertilization to 50° and 75° F. None of the eggs was adversely affected. The temperature changes took place within one-half hour. The mean incubation period was determined to vary from about 2 1/4 days at a constant temperature of 75° F. to nearly 10 days at 55° F. The observations presented lead to the conclusion that temperature changes in the ranges indicated are not directly responsible for the death of smallmouth bass embryos.},
