# Introduction

**hatchR** has a built in function—`predict_spawn()`—which allows users to predict when a fish's parent spawned based on the observation of either when a fish hatched or emerged. The function works almost exactly the same as `predict_phenology()` but walks backwards from the point of development (hatch or emerge) and outputs spawn date.

# Workflow

`predict_spawn()` works in essentially the same fashion as you learned about for `predict_phenology()` in the [Predict fish phenology: basic](https://bmait101.github.io/hatchR/articles/Predict_phenology_basic.html) vignette. First you have to select a developmental model. This will be determined by what life history stage from which you have empirical phenology data. For example, maybe you snorkeled a stream and observed bull trout emerging from a redd.

## Model selection

Because our empirical data are from observing juvenile bull trout emergence we will use the bull trout emergence model using `model_select()` and our `model_table`. However, if you have custom models those could be used in the same fashion.

```{r}
#select bull trout emergence model
bt_emerge_mod <- model_select(author = "Austin et al. 2019",
                                      species = "bull trout",
                                      model = "MM",
                                      development_type = "emerge"
                              )
```

## Predict spawning

We'll use our `crooked_river` data set, which is temperature data from a reach of spawning bull trout. With model in hand we'll predict spawn timing assuming we observed fish emerging March 21, 2015.

```{r}
#predict spawn timing using "2015-03-21" emergence date
bt_spawn <- predict_spawn(data = crooked_river,
              dates = date,
              temperature = temp_c,
              develop.date = "2015-03-21",
              model = bt_emerge_mod
              )
```

The outputted object has the exact same structure as a `predict_phenology()` output. They include the slots:

-   `days_to_develop`: days from hatch or emergence to spawn

-   `dev_period`: a 1x2 dataframe where `start`= predicted spawn time and `stop`=empirical developmental event used for prediction in the model.

-   `ef_table`: a n x 5 tibble where n is the number of days from spawn to development. *Note that the table is ordered from the development date and moves backwards in time.* The columns are:

    -   `index`: the row number in the temperature data set

    -   `dates`: dates imported from your temperature data

    -   `temperature`: daily average temperature imported from your temperature data

    -   `ef_vals`: every day's individual effective value

    -   `ef_cumsum`: the cumulative sum of effective values moving backwards from 1, a fish hatches when `ef_cumsum` \<= 0.

-   `model_specs`: model specifications imported from the developmental model provided to `predict_phenology()`

A summary of the above output for `bt_spawn` is presented below.

```{r}
str(bt_spawn)
```

So we see, the fish took 188 days to emerge with a predicted spawning date of September 15, 2014.

```{r}
# development time
bt_spawn$days_to_develop

# spawning date
bt_spawn$dev_period$start
```

Finally, because the model output is in essentially the same format as that from `predict_phenology()` it can be plotted using `plot_phenology()` .

```{r}
plot_phenology(bt_spawn)
```

### Compare to `predict_phenology()`

To demonstrate this provides the same information as `predict_phenology()` we can compare the outputs. Now we will use the predicted spawn date of `"2014-09-15"` as our input in `predict_phenology()`.

```{r}
bt_emerge <- predict_phenology(data = crooked_river,
              dates = date,
              temperature = temp_c,
              spawn.date = "2014-09-15",
              model = bt_emerge_mod
              )
```

And we can compare `dev_period` to verify the outputs match.

```{r}
# are they the same (yes!)
bt_emerge$dev_period == bt_spawn$dev_period

#print out values
bt_emerge$dev_period; bt_spawn$dev_period

```

## Using multiple inputs for `predict_spawn()`

Like `predict_phenology()`, `predict_spawn()` can easily be mapped across multiple variable sets to automate the function. We can use a simple example of observing emerging fish across multiple months to demonstrate.

We'll assume we observed fish emerging February 15, March 15, and April 15 in 2015. And then `map()` the function across those dates using the `purrr` package.

```{r}
library(purrr)

#vector of dates
emerge_days <- c("2015-02-15","2015-03-15", "2015-04-15")

# object for predicting spawn timing across three emergence days
bt_multiple_emerge <- map(emerge_days, # vector of emergence dates
                          predict_spawn, # predict_spawn function
                          # everything below are arguments to predict_spawn()
                          data = crooked_river,
                          dates = date,
                          temperature = temp_c,
                          model = bt_emerge_mod)

# we can access just the dev_periods using map_df
# the start column provides the predicted spawn dates
bt_multiple_emerge |> 
  map_df("dev_period")
```

Based on our predictions, the fish spawned for our respective observed emergence dates on August 29, September 11, and September 27 in 2014.

`predict_spawn()` can be automated to greater extents just like with `predict_phenology()`. We recommend reading the [Predict fish phenology: advanced](https://bmait101.github.io/hatchR/articles/Predict_phenology_advanced.html) vignette to review ways to map across multiple variables.
