**hatchR** is an R package for predicting hatch and emergence timing for
a wide range of wild fishes using the effective value framework (Sparks
et al., (2019) <DOI:10.1139/cjfas-2017-0468>). ‘hatchR’ offers users
access to established phenological models and the flexibility to
incorporate custom parameterizations using external datasets. The
package includes functions for model selection, phenology prediction,
and visualization. **hatchR** is designed to be user-friendly and
accessible to a wide range of users, including researchers, managers,
and educators.

## Example Usage

Below we provide a brief example showing how to use **hatchR**. For a
thorough introduction to the software, see our introductory vignette
[linked
here](https://bmait101.github.io/hatchR/articles/Introduction.html). For
a list of all functions available in **hatchR**, see our function
reference [linked
here](https://bmait101.github.io/hatchR/reference/index.html).

First we load **hatchR** and helper packages by running

``` r
library(hatchR)
library(ggplot2)  # for additional plotting options
library(lubridate)  # for working with dates
```

**hatchR** requires three primary data inputs:

1.  Water temperature data
2.  Species-specific model parameters
3.  Spawning date or date ranges

The example `woody_island` dataset is included in **hatchR** and
contains temperature data from Woody Island, Lake Iliamna, Alaska. It
includes daily water temperature data from 1990-1992. We can use
`plot_check_temp()` to visually check the data. Spawning in this system
typically peaks around August 18 and hatching and emergence are done
before the start of the following spawning season, so we can predict
phenology within a subset of a year. Because `plot_check_temp()` returns
a **ggplot2** object, we can add additional **ggplot2** elements to
customize the plots.

``` r
plot_check_temp(
  data = woody_island,
  dates = date, 
  temperature = temp_c
  ) +  # additional ggplot2 elements below this `+`
  geom_rect(
    aes(
      xmin = ymd("1990-08-18"),  # spawn date
      xmax = ymd("1991-04-01"),  # approx phenology window end
      ymin = -10,  # lower bound
      ymax = 25),  # upper bound
    fill = "grey",
    alpha = 0.01
    ) 
```

Next, select hatch and emerge models we want to use to predict
phenology:

``` r
sockeye_hatch_mod <- model_select(
  author = "Beacham and Murray 1990", 
  species = "sockeye", 
  model = 2, 
  development_type = "hatch"
  )
```

Now we can predict phenology for the sockeye salmon using the
`predict_phenology()` function:

``` r
WI_hatch <- predict_phenology(
  data = woody_island,
  dates = date,
  temperature = temp_c,
  spawn.date = "1990-08-18",
  model = sockeye_hatch_mod
  )
```

We can check the predicted phenology by running:

``` r
# see days to hatch
WI_hatch$days_to_develop
#> [1] 74
# and development period
WI_hatch$dev.period
#>        start       stop
#> 1 1990-08-18 1990-10-30
```

Finally, we can visualize the predicted phenology using
`plot_phenology()`:

``` r
plot_phenology(WI_hatch)
```
